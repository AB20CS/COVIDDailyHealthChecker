# COVID Daily HealthChecker
This repository contains the Arduino source code for the Daily HealthChecker.

Fever is a key indicator of a COVID-19 infection.  People often are asymptomatic through the initial period and itâ€™s critical to effectively measure body temperature for signs of mild fever. The COVID Daily HealthChecker is a tool that allows for a controlled measurement of body temperature which can be validated by health professionals to rule out false positives.
